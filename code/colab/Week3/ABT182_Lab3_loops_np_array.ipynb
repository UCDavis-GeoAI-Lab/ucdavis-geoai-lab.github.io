    "### Step 1: Run the Entire Notebook\n",
    "- Run all code cells to make sure your notebook works correctly and displays all results.\n",
    "- To do this, go to the **Runtime** tab and click **Run all**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Check Your Work\n",
    "- Make sure you followed all instructions.\n",
    "- Confirm that you answered all questions and that the outputs look correct.\n",
    "- Verify that you have completed the Academic Integrity statement at the beginning of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Rename and Save the Notebook\n",
    "- Click on the notebook name at the **top left** of the page.\n",
    "- The default name is:  \n",
    "  `ABT182_Lab3_loops_np_array.ipynb`\n",
    "- Rename the file by replacing **ABT182** with your own name.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Example:**  \n",
    "  `ali_moghimi_hw3.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save the notebook after renaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Create PDF Version\n",
    "- Creating a PDF version of your notebook is **required**.\n",
    "- To create a PDF:\n",
    "  1. Go to the **File** tab (top left).\n",
    "  2. Select **Print** (or press `Ctrl + P` / `Cmd + P`).\n",
    "  3. In the print window, change the **Destination** to **Save as PDF** or **Adobe PDF**.\n",
    "  4. Click **Print** to save the PDF file.\n",
    "- Alternatively: **File** → **Download** → **Download .pdf**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Submit Both Files to Canvas\n",
    "- **Upload BOTH files** to the **Canvas page** for Homework 3:\n",
    "  1. The renamed notebook file (`.ipynb` file) - **REQUIRED**\n",
    "  2. The PDF file (`.pdf` file) - **REQUIRED**\n",
    "- Make sure both files are uploaded before submitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use of Generative AI Tools (GenAI Policy)\n",
    "- This course **discourages the use of generative AI tools** (such as ChatGPT) for completing assignments, as the goal is for you to develop your own coding skills.\n",
    "- If you **do choose to use a generative AI tool**, you must **clearly disclose** this in your notebook.\n",
    "- In your disclosure, briefly explain:\n",
    "  - which tool you used, and  \n",
    "  - how you used it (e.g., debugging, understanding error messages, or clarifying concepts).\n",
    "- Failure to disclose the use of generative AI tools may be considered a violation of course academic integrity policies."
