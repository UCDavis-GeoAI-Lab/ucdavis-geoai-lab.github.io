    "- To do this, go to the **Runtime** tab and click **Run all**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Check Your Work\n",
    "- Make sure you followed all instructions.\n",
    "- Confirm that you answered all questions and that the outputs look correct.\n",

    "### Step 3: Rename and Save the Notebook\n",

    "  `ali_moghimi_hw3.ipynb`\n",

    "### Step 4: Create PDF Version\n",
    "- Creating a PDF version of your notebook is **required**.\n",
    "- To create a PDF:\n",
    "  1. Go to the **File** tab (top left).\n",
    "  2. Select **Print** (or press `Ctrl + P` / `Cmd + P`).\n",
    "  3. In the print window, change the **Destination** to **Save as PDF** or **Adobe PDF**.\n",
    "  4. Click **Print** to save the PDF file.\n",
    "- Alternatively: **File** → **Download** → **Download .pdf**\n",

    "### Step 5: Submit Both Files to Canvas\n",
    "- **Upload BOTH files** to the **Canvas page** for this assignment:\n",
