Therefore, spatial join is not an option as the geometry column is missing (if you used `pd` to import the csv file) or empty (None) (if you used `gpd` to import the csv file). However, both dataframes `gdf` and `df` share a common attribute (column), which is the name of counties. Through attribute join, we can assign the spatial information of each county from the `gdf` (or `cal`) shapefile to the county dataframe (`df`).\n","\n","* The steps above will work if the county name is the same for both dataframes. However, in our case, there is a subtle difference. Check the county column in CSV file and shapefile. For instance, the Yolo county in county shapefile is listed as 'Yolo', but in the CSV file, it is listed as 'Yolo County, CA'. So we need to do data cleaning before doing attribute join.\n","\n","* For data cleaning, we can remove the extra parts by the following command:\n","    ```python\n","    # delete the extra part (' County, CA')\n","    df['County'] = df['County'].str.replace(' County, CA', '')\n","    ```\n","  * Here, we delete ' County, CA' part and replace it with nothing ('  ').\n","    \n","* Now, we want to merge two dataframes that share one similar column `County`.
